**Related LC problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-less-than-k/solution/

You are on a flight and wanna watch two movies during this flight.
You are given List<Integer> movieDurations which includes all the movie durations.
You are also given the duration of the flight which is d in minutes.
Now, you need to pick two movies and the total duration of the two movies is less than or equal to (d - 30min).

Find the pair of movies with the longest total duration and return they indexes. If multiple found, return the pair with the longest movie.

Example 1:

Input: movieDurations = [90, 85, 75, 60, 120, 150, 125], d = 250
Output: [0, 6]
Explanation: movieDurations[0] + movieDurations[6] = 90 + 125 = 215 is the maximum number within 220 (250min - 30min)

There could be duplicate times
We must find a pair whose duration that equals to EXACTLY d - 30
There could be more than 1 pair. If there is more than one pair, you choose the pair that's going to have a larger number in it. (eg. [30, 30] vs. [10, 50], we would choose [10, 50].
Return a pair of indicies.
